This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Initial Setup

1. Run `nvm use` to ensure you are on the correct version of node.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Copy `.env.local.example` and rename to `.env.local`.
4. Populate the `.env.local` file with values for `NEXT_PUBLIC_NINETAILED_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_NINETAILED_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENTFUL_ENV_ID`, `CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_KEY`, and `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_KEY`.
5. Note that `CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_SECRET` and `CONTENTFUL_REVALIDATION_SECRET` are keys that you will need to invent, and should ideally be different.
6. Configure a Content Preview within Contentful with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/draft?secret=[ADD CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_SECRET HERE]&type=page&slug={entry.fields.slug}`
7. Create a custom Webhook in Contentful that fires on Entry `Create`, `Archive`, `Unarchive`, `Publish`, `Unpublish`, and `Delete`, pointing to the revalidation endpoint with your secret key added: `/api/revalidate?secret=[ADD CONTENTFUL_REVALIDATE_SECRET HERE]`. NOTE: If running this locally, Contentful cannot post a Webhook to `localhost`, so you will need to use ngrok to publicly serve the endpoint (e.g. `ngrok http 3000`).
8. Assuming you have already installed the [Contentful CLI](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/cli/installation/), import the baseline content model via the following command: `contentful space import --space-id <YOUR SPACE ID> --environment-id [YOUR ENVIRONMENT ID] --content-file space-export.json`.
9. If you haven't already, head over to [https://app.ninetailed.io](https://app.ninetailed.io) and create your Ninetailed account.
10. Within your Contentful Space, head over to the App Marketplace and install the Ninetailed app, following the steps to authenticatem, connect Ninetailed to Contentful, and configure a content source. NOTE: You will only want to enabled Ninetailed for `ðŸ’Ž Duplex` and `ðŸ’Ž Hero Banner component` for now.
11. Additionally, you will also need to install the `Repeater` app from the App Marketplace, as it is required to demonstrate the dynamic profile trait adjustments using the `Option Selector` component.
12. Run `npm run dev`, which will serve the application on the default port (likely `3000`).

## Using the demo

- When you navigate to http://localhost:3000, you should see a generic Hero banner, as well as a component that allows you to select your preferred animal.
- Selecting a preferred animal will automatically `identify` you, adding this as a trait to your Ninetailed profile. This will automatically update the Hero component that you see, and will retain this on subsequent page reloads.
- You can actually use the `Option Selector` component to create your own selections here, and as long as the `Trait` field and `Options` field values correspond to traits you are tracking on a Ninetailed Audience (added to the same Contentful Space) it should just work.
- This should also work with Live Preview, as well as the Ninetailed Preview plugin.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
